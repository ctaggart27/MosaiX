World Wide Pixel Art Database


Our site is a Social Network for artists and game developers with a couple features that cater to their needs.

Features:
-Create a profile -OR- Google Login(buggy at the moment)
    -Create username
    -Upload Profile Picture(~bug~ not rendering correctly since our deployment to a live host)
    -Update Profile with details about you etc
-Create a Sprite:
   -Import photos(size limited// Needs to be more clear on what can upload)
   -Export Photos to desktop in multiple file formats(.zip, .gif, .png etc)
   -Draw pixel art with out creator suite
   -Ability to animate your sprite (will be saved as a spritesheet(look into it if you don't know what it is pretty sick though) or exported as a .gif
   -Name the sprite, add details about the sprite (~~BUG~~ without name it won't upload)
   -save to your profile on our site
   -Update sprite details, (~~BUG~~ can't update name yet)
   -Add tags to the sprite (searchable tags that will display other sprites with the same tag)(~BUG~ Search function is still a bit buggy)
   -Add Comments on other users sprites
   -Like the sprite
FEEDS:
   -My Creations will show up
   -Followers sprites (you can follow other users)
   -Most recent sprites

Lots of other features I'm probably forgetting but pretty soon I will have a game engine added on so that users can plug their sprite into a game engine and test out their animations and make adjustments
